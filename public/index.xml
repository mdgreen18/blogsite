      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, World! My name is Matthew and this is my first foray into blogging. I am a husband, father, and all around nerd. Never really been one to talk about myself much but hoping this will make it easier to put myself out there for the world to see. I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with emphasis in Game and Simulation Programming and still staying up-to-date on current trends as much as I can. Looking to get my foot in the door in the tech field still as I am very determined to get my career going into full swing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on a dedicated journey to transition into the &lt;strong&gt;tech field&lt;/strong&gt; to follow my lifelong passion for &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most of my career, I was in &lt;strong&gt;Management&lt;/strong&gt;, where I honed critical skills in problem-solving, project coordination, and operational adaptabilityâ€”all invaluable for a successful career in software development. My recent career choices have been driven by a commitment to my family, including supporting my mother. Now that I have more time to focus, I&amp;rsquo;m fully dedicating myself to launching my new career path, building a better future for us all. When I&amp;rsquo;m not learning, I&amp;rsquo;m a proud father of two sons and happily married since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
