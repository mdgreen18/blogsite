      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-agents-what-are-they-&#34;&gt;AI Agents: What are they? üïµüèª&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear off the bat, an AI agent isn&amp;rsquo;t like Agent Smith from the Matrix. Well not yet at least&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;AI agent&lt;/strong&gt; is essentially a system that can reason, plan, and interact with its environment to achieve a goal set by the user. It&amp;rsquo;s a goal-oriented machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An agent is made up of two main components. The first is the &lt;strong&gt;LLM&lt;/strong&gt; (Large Language Model), which is the &lt;strong&gt;brain&lt;/strong&gt; of the system. The LLM allows the agent to understand your natural language, handle the reasoning, and plan the actions it will take. The second component is the &lt;strong&gt;body&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîthe &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; the agent uses to interact with the world. These tools can be simple programs the agent calls upon, or more complex APIs that access real-time data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, World! My name is Matthew and this is my first foray into blogging. I am a husband, father, and all around nerd. Never really been one to talk about myself much but hoping this will make it easier to put myself out there for the world to see. I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with emphasis in Game and Simulation Programming and still staying up-to-date on current trends as much as I can. Looking to get my foot in the door in the tech field still as I am very determined to get my career going into full swing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
