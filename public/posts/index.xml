      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, World! My name is Matthew and this is my first foray into blogging. I am a husband, father, and all around nerd. Never really been one to talk about myself much but hoping this will make it easier to put myself out there for the world to see. I have a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science with emphasis in Game and Simulation Programming and still staying up-to-date on current trends as much as I can. Looking to get my foot in the door in the tech field still as I am very determined to get my career going into full swing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
