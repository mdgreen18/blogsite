Hello, World! My name is Matthew and this is my first foray into blogging. I am a husband, father, and all around nerd. Never really been one to talk about myself much but hoping this will make it easier to put myself out there for the world to see. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with emphasis in Game and Simulation Programming and still staying up-to-date on current trends as much as I can. Looking to get my foot in the door in the tech field still as I am very determined to get my career going into full swing. 


The purpose for me starting one is really just to showcase what I am learning about. Currently, I am working through the [Hugging Face AI Agents course](https://huggingface.co/learn/agents-course/unit0/introduction). Almost done with Unit 1 and will try to blog about what I have learned and challenges that I may have had. But I also would like to just blog about some other stuff from time to time as well. Whether it be about some hobbies I have to just random stuff that pops up in my life. 

For setting up this site, I used Hugo to process Obsidian markdown and uploaded this to GitHub pages. Here are a few video links that I used to learn to do so:

Well I think this is where I will leave it for my first blog. I am looking forward to posting more and excited for what the future holds!

P.S. Comments aren't functional just yet! I wanted to get this first post out ASAP to start sharing my learning journey, but I'll be integrating a commenting solution soon.
