I'm on a dedicated journey to transition into the **tech field** to follow my lifelong passion for **programming**.

For most of my career, I was in **Management**, where I honed critical skills in problem-solving, project coordination, and operational adaptabilityâ€”all invaluable for a successful career in software development. My recent career choices have been driven by a commitment to my family, including supporting my mother. Now that I have more time to focus, I'm fully dedicating myself to launching my new career path, building a better future for us all. When I'm not learning, I'm a proud father of two sons and happily married since 2018.

## Why This Blog?

This space serves as my public **learning log and portfolio**, a place to showcase the **projects I'm building** and share my understanding of new concepts.

My current focus is deep diving into **Python**, experimenting with **AI Agents**, and learning the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**â€”the standard for securely connecting AI systems to external data and tools.

My hope is that it can provide **clarity for fellow self-learners** who may be struggling with the same subjects, and perhaps I can get **valuable advice** from experienced developers who stop by. I'll also occasionally take a break from code to talk about my other passions, like **video games, D&D, movies, and sports!**
